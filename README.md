# Day-of-the-Week

A simple C program that takes a number from 1 to 7 as input and prints the corresponding day of the week.

The user is prompted to enter a number between 1 and 7.

The program uses a switch statement to match the input to a day:

- 1 → Monday
- 2 → Tuesday
- 3 → Wednesday
- 4 → Thursday
- 5 → Friday
- 6 → Saturday
- 7 → Sunday
- If the input is not in the range of 1-7, the program prints "Invalid".
